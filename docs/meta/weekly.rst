Summary of the weekly full-team meetings.


2017-10-10
==========

- We stressed the fact that the *arch* team needs precise specifications from
  the module teams to take meaningful decisions.
- In two groups we started this specification work, coming up with drafts of
  these specifications for the *discussion*, *calendar* and *multimedia*
  modules.
- We talked about how to design useful specifications and how to organize the
  next meetings. Things that were brought up: specification by examples
  (so-called *scenarios*) and scrum.

Goals for the next meeting:

- The module teams should come up with precise specifications and rough
  mockups.
- The arch team should present the precise architecture of the project (how
  modules will mesh up together, what technology stack will be used, etc.).
- The UX team should give mockups for the module-agnostic views (mainly the
  landing page, with some kind of dashboard).
