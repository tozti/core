Getting Started

Our first extension
===================

Let's see how to create a simple extension to *tozti*.
Everything defined by an extension lives inside the same folder, whose name is the name of the extension.

Suppose we call it ``extension-name``. Browse to the ``extensions/`` folder and proceed to create a folder ``extension-name``.
The only requirement for *tozti* to recognize an extension is for this extension to provide a file ``server.py`` declaring a dictionnary ``MANIFEST``.
Thus a minimal definition would like like so::

    MANIFEST = {}

Well done, you've just created your first extension!


Defining an API endpoint
========================

The previous extension currently does nothing. We will now see how to add new API endpoints to the application.

At the moment our ``MANIFEST`` is empty. To declare new routes, we must import some modules::

    from tozti.utils import RouterDef
    from aiohttp import web
    from tozti import logger

- ``RouterDef`` allows us to define a new router and therefore new request handlers.
- ``web`` from ``aiohttp`` enables us to send back to the user simple responses.
- ``logger`` is a simple utility to pretty print information in the server logs.

Then, we create an empty router::

    router = RouterDef()

And we add one endpoint to it. We call it ``hello_world``, and make it accessible from the URL ``<tozti>/api/extension-name/hello_world``::

    hello_world = router.add_resource('/hello_world')

Finally, we define how our extension should behave when this endpoint is requested. In this example, we respond to ``GET`` requests on this endpoint with some dummy text::

    @hello_world.get
    async def hello_world_get(req):
        logger.info("hello world")
        return web.Response(text='Hello world!')

Similar decorators are available for the usual HTTP methods: ``@hello_world.post``, etc.

Unfortunately, for now *tozti* still isn't aware of this new request handler we just defined. This is where ``MANIFEST`` comes into use: We simply add the router in the ``MANIFEST`` dict under the key ``router``::

    MANIFEST = {
        'router': router,
    }

In fact, ``MANIFEST`` is where we declare anything that *tozti* should be made aware of.

And now, if you launch the server again, and visit the URL ``<tozti>/api/extension-name/hello_world``, your web browser should display a blank web page with the text *"Hello world!"*. If you look in the server logs, some ``hello world`` must have appeared.


Providing custom javascript to the tozti application
====================================================

If the previous paragraph showed how to serve content on specific URLs, this is *not* how we modify the behavior of the *tozti* application. *tozti* is a single-page app built with the framework **Vue.js**. Therefore if you want to be able to interact with the application and define new interactions, you need to be able to serve custom *javascript* code to the client.

As a convention, all static assets must be put inside a folder ``dist`` inside your extension folder.
Let's create a file called ``index.js`` inside ``extension-name/dist/``:

.. code-block:: javascript

  Vue.component('extension-name-widget', {
    template: '<div class="uk-placeholder">A widget coming directly from our extension! :)</div>'
  })

  tozti.$store.commit('registerWidget', 'extension-name-widget')

As you might have guessed, we need to inform *tozti* of the existence of this file, inside ``MANIFEST``::

  MANIFEST = {
    # ..
    'includes': ['index.js']
  }

Once again, start the server and visit the URL ``<tozti>/``. A new widget should have appeared inside the Dashboard.

As stated below, adding CSS files in this ``includes`` list in exactly the same fashion allows the inclusion of custom CSS to *tozti*.

Quick note on file structure
----------------------------
Most extensions do not serve directly their javascript files to *tozti*. They often split their code in separate files, and use some build process to obtain a single file ``build.js`` out of their code. This is the file that they send to the client. We will not describe here how to setup such a build process, as it would end up very much opinionated, and still would have to differ between extensions. However it is very much recommended to proceed in such a way, and the sample extensions available on our github page provide some insight as to how things can be organised.

Going further with MANIFEST
===========================

Here are a complete list of keys that `MANIFEST` can possess:
``router``
   This is used to declare new API endpoints. It should be an instance of
   :py:class:`tozti.utils.RouterDef`. More precisely it must have an
   :py:meth:`add_prefix` method and it will be passed to
   :py:meth:`aiohttp.web.UrlDispatcher.add_routes`. Every route declared will
   be prefixed by ``/api/<extension-name>``.

``includes``
   A list of css or js filenames that must be included in the main
   ``index.html``. Usually you will put there your ``main.js`` which contains
   the code to register or patch components.

``_god_mode``
   Beware, this can be dangerous if used incorrectly! This should be a function
   taking as argument the main :py:class:`aiohttp.web.Application` object.
   You can use it to register custom middlewares or do otherwise weird stuff.

``dependencies``
    A list of names of extensions that must be loaded before this extension in 
    order for it to be working as intended.
